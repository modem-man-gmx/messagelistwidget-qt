Sample and Demo codes.

This is showing how to use it in a minimalistic Qt application which aside supports Signal/Slot

rDebug_CLIDemo  : demonstrate a number of variations how to further use qDebug/qWarn/q... 
                  as well as rDebug/rInfo/rNotice/... which are reflecting more the BSD syslog idea
				  the App is fully SIGNAL/SLOT capable, but does not report the logging to a slot

rDebug_FileDemo : same as rDebug_CliDemo, 
                  but additionally a logfile is written, 
                  which in addition can reduce the number of logging lines (by giving a lesser level)

rDebug_SLOTDemo : same as rDebug_CliDemo, 
                  but additionally logging information is sent to a SLOT 
				  and captured / handled there
